# TSD-Website
UCSD TSD Website

Feel free to add any notes that you may have for future TSd webdev people in the README.md file.

## 1. About
This repository is for storing all versions of the TSD website (on anne118193's repository). All excess test code / iterations on the website should be placed here. 
  example: folder: 7-14-2022 is the website version that was published on 7-14-22 
                  this version is the "website under construction" version, it basically only contains a title page and a bunch of racoon pics
                  
The official TSD website repository is on the actual TSD github account (sign in with TSD email (TSD@ucsd.edu)). The official TSD website repository should only 
contain the code for what is CURRENTLY published on the website.

Further documentation can be found in the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1TD50FsGsiE5XADJbnY7M2vgpuN2EVm7Q)


## 2. Todos

Ranked by priority

- [x] fill out the [free website guys](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1nMxQ0P90SAWPb0Kms8k217DAjo4GgO_W) template
        <-- we decided not to do that 
- [x] begin designing the actual website 
      Either start from scratch <-- this one
                OR
      Edit/Alter the code that is in the official TSD github [(documentation)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/145GG1HKFKvablGzENxLJHERmyHpwFhD4b2t5laEOHgY/edit)
      <!-- email asl006@ucsd.edu if you have questions about it --> 
\
\
If we do NOT want to start from scratch
  - [ ] make each team page and add memebers + pics + bio + proper links to each profile
  - [x] design sponsors page
  - [x] design resources page <-- got rid of this page
  - [x] outline/begin documentation for the website

## 3. Sponsors Page
A couple ideas for this page:
  - do something similar to each team page where we have each company's logo and a short description on who they are, what thier controbutions were, a link to thier website, etc
  - rank them in terms of contribution size (largest contributer at the top)

## 4. Resources Page
A couple ideas for this page:
  - links/references to all softwares that we use and documentation on how to use them 
  - some sort of documentation of each team's workflow 

## 5. Each Team Page
A couple ideas for this page:
  - include current projects/tasks to allow new members to find things that they are interested in doing
