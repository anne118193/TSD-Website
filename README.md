# TSD-Website
UCSD TSD Website

Feel free to add any notes that you may have for future TSd webdev people in the README.md file.

<!--
This repository is for storing all versions of the TSD website (on anne118193 repository). All excess test code / iterations on the website should be placed here. 
  example: folder: 7-14-2022 is the website version that was published on 7-14-22
            this version is the "website under construction" version, it basically only contains a title page and a bunch of racoon pics

The official TSD website repository is on the actual TSD github account (sign in with TSD email (TSD@ucsd.edu)). The official TSD website repository should only 
contain the code for what is CURRENTLY published on the website.
